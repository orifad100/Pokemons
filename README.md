# Pokemon's Project
C project - Advanced programming course 1nd semester, 2nd year.


This project was done as part of the “Advanced programming course”. The aim of the project is to create and use structs, pointers (include function pointers to data-sigment), memory allocations and memory leaks. This project is a combination of 2 parts .

Pokemon-part1 is about building a "Pokedex" and including modules such as:

Defs.h: definitions header.

Pokemon.h: pokemon module interface.

Pokemon.c: pokemon module imp.

Pokemon-part2 is about building generic abstract data types in C programming lang. this project including modules such as:

Defs.h: definitions header.

Pokemon.h/ Pokemon.c: pokemon module header and source files.

MaxHeap.h/ MaxHeap.c: generic maximum heap header and source files.

LinkedList.h/ LinkedList.c: genericLinked list header and source files.

BattleByCategory.h/.c: generic ADT that can generates fights between struct objects that support the requirements (such as Pokemons module).

The code was checked with Valgrind memory leaks checker - memory leaks free code
